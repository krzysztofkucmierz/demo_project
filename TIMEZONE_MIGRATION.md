# Timezone-Aware Timestamp Migration

This directory contains the migration for converting all timestamp columns from `timestamp without time zone` to `timestamp with time zone`.

## Overview

**Issue**: #18 - [HIGH PRIORITY] Migrate Timestamps to Timezone-Aware Format

**Problem**: All timestamp columns in the database used `timestamp without time zone`, causing issues in global applications where users are in different timezones.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
- **File**: `migrations/versions/migrate_timestamps_to_timezone_aware.py`
- **Action**: Alters 6 columns across 3 tables
- **Tables affected**:
  - `reviewers`: created_at, updated_at
  - `reviewed_objects`: created_at, updated_at
  - `reviews`: created_at, updated_at

### 2. Model Updates
- **File**: `app/models.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added TIMESTAMP import from sqlalchemy
  - Updated all timestamp fields to use `TIMESTAMP(timezone=True)`
  - Changed from `sa_column_kwargs` to explicit `sa_column=Column(...)`

### 3. Validation
- **File**: `validate_timezone_migration.py` - Comprehensive validation script
- **File**: `tests/test_timezone_timestamps.py` - Unit tests for timezone behavior

## Migration Commands

### To Apply Migration
```bash
# Review the migration first
alembic show migrate_timestamps_to_timezone_aware

# Apply the migration
alembic upgrade head
```

### To Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Rollback to previous migration
alembic downgrade add_reviewed_object_id_indexes
```

## Validation

Run the validation script to ensure everything is configured correctly:

```bash
python validate_timezone_migration.py
```

## Testing

Test timezone functionality:

```bash
python tests/test_timezone_timestamps.py
```

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Downtime Required**: Yes (table locks during ALTER operations)
- **Impact**: All applications must handle timezone-aware datetimes
- **Rollback**: Available via downgrade migration

## Benefits

- ✅ Proper global timezone support
- ✅ Accurate temporal queries across timezones
- ✅ Better data consistency in distributed systems
- ✅ Future-proof for international expansion

## Post-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Verify all timestamp columns show `timestamp with time zone` in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Test application functionality with timezone-aware datetimes
- [ ] Monitor for any timezone-related issues
- [ ] Update any hardcoded SQL queries that assume naive timestamps
- [ ] Validate that existing data maintains correct temporal relationships

## Implementation Notes

- The `utc_now()` function already returned timezone-aware datetimes, so no Python code changes were needed
- Server defaults remain `NOW()` which PostgreSQL will interpret as timezone-aware for the new column types
- All existing data will be preserved during the migration
- The migration is reversible via the downgrade function
