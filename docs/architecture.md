# Module Architecture Documentation

## Module Metadata

- **Module Name**: `review`
- **Key Functionality**: Automated review management system for generic objects with multiple rating types (text, star ratings, thumbs up/down)
- **Special Considerations**: Designed as a standalone component that can be integrated into larger systems; supports flexible object types and multiple rating mechanisms
- **Last Updated**: August 12, 2025

## 1. Module Overview

The review management module is a standalone Python component that provides comprehensive review functionality for any type of object (products, events, performances, movies, stores, etc.). Built using SQLModel and designed with the repository pattern, it offers a clean separation of concerns and can be easily integrated into larger applications.

The module's primary responsibilities include:

- Managing reviewer profiles and authentication
- Handling various types of reviewable objects with flexible metadata
- Processing and storing multiple types of reviews (text, star ratings, thumbs ratings)
- Enforcing business rules and data integrity constraints
- Providing database abstraction through repository patterns

This module exists as a separate component to ensure reusability across different domains and applications while maintaining a focused, single-responsibility design.

## 2. Key Components

### `models.py`: Database Models and Schemas

The models file defines the core data structures using SQLModel, which serves as both SQLAlchemy ORM models and Pydantic schemas:

**Core Models:**

- `Reviewer`: User entity with username, email, and profile information
- `ReviewedObject`: Generic object that can be reviewed (flexible object_type and metadata)
- `Review`: The review entity linking reviewers to objects with rating data

**Schema Variants:**

- `*Create`: Input schemas for creating new entities
- `*Read`: Output schemas for API responses
- `*Update`: Partial update schemas for modifications
- `ReviewStatistics`: Aggregated statistics view model

**Key Features:**

- UUID-based primary keys with PostgreSQL `gen_random_uuid()`
- Automatic timestamp management with UTC timezone handling
- JSONB metadata storage for flexible object attributes
- Comprehensive constraint validation (rating ranges, required content)
- Unique constraints preventing duplicate reviews

### `repositories.py`: Data Access Layer

Implements the repository pattern for database operations:

**Repository Classes:**

- `ReviewerRepository`: CRUD operations for reviewer management
- `ReviewedObjectRepository`: Flexible object storage and retrieval
- `ReviewRepository`: Review creation, updates, and complex queries

**Key Features:**

- Session-based transaction management
- Comprehensive error handling with rollback on conflicts
- Pagination support for all list operations
- Specialized query methods (by username, email, object type, etc.)
- Integrity constraint enforcement with meaningful error messages

### `database.py`: Database Configuration

Centralized database connection and session management:

- PostgreSQL engine configuration with connection pooling
- Environment-based configuration (`DATABASE_URL`)
- SQLModel table creation utilities
- Dependency injection session factory for FastAPI integration
- Production-ready connection settings (pool recycling, health checks)

### Missing Components (Future Implementation)

Based on the coding standards, the following components would complete the architecture:

- `routers.py`: FastAPI route definitions with dependency injection
- `service.py`: Business logic layer between repositories and API
- `dependencies.py`: Dependency injection providers for repositories and services

## 3. Data Flow

### Typical Request Flow

```text
API Request → Router → Service Layer → Repository → Database
     ↓
Response ← Schema Validation ← Business Logic ← Query Result ← SQL
```

**Request Handling Path:**

1. **API Layer**: FastAPI routes receive and validate input
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic processing and validation
3. **Repository Layer**: Database query construction and execution
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLModel ORM

**Data Transformation Steps:**

1. Input validation through Pydantic schemas (`*Create`, `*Update` models)
2. Business rule enforcement in service layer
3. Repository pattern abstracts database operations
4. Response formatting through `*Read` schemas

**Database Interactions:**

- Session-based transactions with automatic rollback
- UUID-based relationships between entities
- Constraint validation at database level
- JSONB for flexible metadata storage

## 4. Integration Points

### Database Integration

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store with advanced features (UUID, JSONB, constraints)
- **Alembic**: Database migration management
- **SQLModel**: ORM and schema validation

### External Systems

- **Environment Configuration**: Database URL and settings via environment variables
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized for high-concurrency scenarios
- **Health Checks**: Built-in connection validation

### Shared Utilities

- **UTC Timezone Handling**: Standardized datetime management
- **UUID Generation**: Consistent identifier strategy across entities
- **Error Handling**: Centralized exception patterns

## 5. Authentication and Authorization

**Current State**: The module currently focuses on data modeling and doesn't implement authentication mechanisms.

**Future Requirements:**

- User authentication for reviewer identity verification
- Role-based access control for different operations
- Review ownership validation (users can only edit their own reviews)
- Admin permissions for moderation capabilities

**Security Considerations:**

- Unique constraints prevent review spam (one review per user per object)
- Input validation through Pydantic schemas prevents injection attacks
- Database constraints enforce data integrity

## 6. Error Handling

### Exception Strategy

- **IntegrityError Handling**: Caught and converted to meaningful ValueError messages
- **Automatic Rollback**: Session rollback on constraint violations
- **Null Safety**: Comprehensive null handling with optional fields

### Validation Approaches

- **Schema Validation**: Pydantic models enforce type safety and constraints
- **Database Constraints**: Multi-level validation (field, record, relationship)
- **Business Rules**: Enforced through check constraints and unique indexes

**Error Response Patterns:**

```python
try:
    self.session.commit()
    return entity
except IntegrityError as e:
    self.session.rollback()
    raise ValueError(f"Operation failed: {e}") from e
```

## 7. Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques

- **Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy pool with recycling and health checks
- **Pagination**: Built-in offset/limit support for large datasets
- **Indexes**: Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields (username, email, object_type)
- **Lazy Loading**: SQLModel relationships configured for efficient loading

### Potential Bottlenecks

- **Complex Aggregations**: Review statistics may require optimization for large datasets
- **JSONB Queries**: Object metadata searches could benefit from specialized indexes
- **Cross-Object Queries**: Multi-table joins may need query optimization

**Caching Strategies** (Future):

- Review statistics could benefit from caching mechanisms
- Frequently accessed objects might use Redis caching
- Database query result caching for read-heavy workloads

## 8. Testing Strategy

### Current Test Coverage

The module includes comprehensive tests using pytest:

**Test Categories:**

- **Repository Tests**: Database operations and constraint validation
- **Schema Tests**: Model validation and serialization
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing

**Key Test Scenarios:**

- CRUD operations for all entities
- Constraint violation handling
- Data integrity verification
- Pagination and querying functionality

**Mock Requirements:**

- SQLite in-memory database for fast test execution
- JSONB compatibility layer for cross-database testing
- Session fixture management for isolated tests

**Test Database Strategy:**

```python
# SQLite compatibility for JSONB fields
def mock_visit_JSONB(self, type_, **kwargs):
    return str(self.visit_JSON(type_, **kwargs))

SQLiteTypeCompiler.visit_JSONB = mock_visit_JSONB
```

### Integration Test Considerations

- Database transaction isolation
- Foreign key constraint testing
- Concurrent access scenarios
- Migration testing with Alembic
